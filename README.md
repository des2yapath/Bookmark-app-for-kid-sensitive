# Kid-Friendly Social Bookmarking App

## Overview

This is a terminal-based Java application that simulates a simplified social bookmarking system. The application allows users to bookmark various types of content (Books, WebLinks), while a special user role (Chief Editor) can mark and share bookmarks that are considered kid-friendly.

This project demonstrates practical object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java and applies concepts such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and basic filtering logic.
